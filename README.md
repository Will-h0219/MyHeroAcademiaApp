# MyHeroAcademiaApp

This project was made from scratch with Angular, this is an applicaiton that allows the user to search for the characters of My Hero Academia Anime, it consumes the [My Hero Academia API](https://myheroacademiaapi.com) made by [Renan Teixeira](https://github.com/renant) and it's meant to be consuming another API when the user is logged, so in this scenario the users can manage characters created by themselves, something like fanarts, ideas for incoming seasosns, etc. This API is another project made by me and you can find it and it's documentation [here](https://github.com/Will-h0219/MHA.API.git).

However, by the time you are reading this the application just uses Renan's API, I'll be uploading the full implementation of my API as soon as I finished it.

Beyond seeing characters (originals and custom ones), this application is a personal project where I applied all sort of things that I've been learning in my way to become a fullstack programmer, this one specifically uses Angular and I tried to put into it the best practices like clean code, components to re-use chunks of code, lazy load for modules and different components; also I used a folder structure that allows high scalability and maintainability, for that [this](https://itnext.io/choosing-a-highly-scalable-folder-structure-in-angular-d987de65ec7) article was really useful. Another feature present in the application is the use of [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) for the style of some components to enhance the UX.

## Development server
